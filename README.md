# IPL T20 ball-by-ball simulator

This is an in-depth IPL ball by ball simulator that uses past data of each player in the IPL to predict outcomes on each ball based on various factors.

This is still in the pre-release phase so there are a lot of bugs.
## How to download it
Go to this link - https://filetransfer.io/manage-package/lCQ95dXO and run the installer. (note that you will not get updates if you download this)

### How to run it
There will be three .bat files - 
1. custom.bat
2. IPL.bat
3. IPL_remaining.bat

In the first one, you can play any two IPL teams by inputting their initials (eg. DC, CSK, PBKS, etc.).
In the second, you just open it and simulates and entire IPL season, all the scorecards are saved in the /scores folder along with the batStats.txt and bowlStats.txt files.
In the third, you can simulate the remainder of the IPL 2021 season that has been suspended for now.

### Bugs
1. There are no no-balls or byes
2. Sometimes batsman who bowl very rarely bowl their full 4 overs
3. Due to these bugs and some more, I have not made this the final release and decided to make it public due to many requests
